Dependencies: Nodejs, bower, gulp

run the below shell scripts
1. npm install
2. bower install
3. gulp

open browser to localhost:3000
if this doesn't work it may be because your port is taken, look at the shell console to see which port has been designated
if it still doesnt work, try to rerun gulp again
if this time it doesnt work then well... not sure... contact me?
